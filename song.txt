Pick it, pack it, fire it up, come aloooong
And take a hit from the boooong
Put the blunt down just for a second
Don't get me wrong it's not a new method
Inhale, exhale - just got a ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double barrel bong is gettin me stoned
Home skillet, there's water inside don't spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet
Still it, goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky funky smelly green shit
Sing my song, puff all night long
As I take hits from the bong...

Hits from the bong y'all

Verse2
It smells like shit on the carpet
Still it, goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky funky smelly green shit
Sing my song, puff all night long
As I take hits from the bong...



Verse3
It smells like shit on the carpet
Still it, goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky funky smelly green shit
Sing my song, puff all night long
As I take hits from the bong...
